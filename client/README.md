SECTION 2: Innovative Idea

    Our application is two folds based on the personal creation. A person would input information based on monthly spendings and savings, and depending on which account-type they choose we would either organize an individualâ€™s finances and provide saving/spending tips; or focus solely on suggesting different spending habits geared towards benefitting the local community.

    Although there are many finance management apps out there, what sets us apart is that we guide people towards a more budget-friendly or humanitarian-like lifestyle if they so desire.



SECTION 3: 

    There are numerous features to this application. If a person chooses the more budget-friendly account, we would suggest part time jobs if their rate of spending is greater than the rate of savings. We would do this by taking in an individual interest and availability and use our automated technology to find a job most suited for them. Another functionality this account would have is that it offers local deals so it is more accessible. For the humanitarian based account, we would focus on suggesting ways to distribute surplus wealth through various local organizations or non-profit groups.
