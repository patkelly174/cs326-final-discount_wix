User Interactions (Same as milestone 0): 
    There are numerous features to this application. If a person chooses the more budget-friendly account, we would suggest part time jobs if their rate of spending is greater than the rate of savings. We would do this by taking in an individual interest and availability and use our automated technology to find a job most suited for them. Another functionality this account would have is that it offers local deals so it is more accessible. For the humanitarian based account, we would focus on suggesting ways to distribute surplus wealth through various local organizations or non-profit groups.
