###### COMPSCI 326 Final Project

### Our Goal

Our application aims to save everyone money while also trying to aid the community. You will input your monthly income, spending, and savings, and we will organize an your finances and provide saving/spending tips. We will also suggest different spending habits geared towards benefitting the local community.

### Inside our application

After inputing all relevant information our website will display your current financial situation in a informative way. If you have a surplus of money we will suggest various local charities and ways to give back to the community. If you are in the negative for a monthly budget we will supply you with various cost cutting measures such as local coupons and changes to your current budget.

#### Future Work

In our first iteration of the application we did not implement the job suggestions and charity suggestions due to lack of time. We also did not implement authentication.
