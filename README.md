SECTION 2: Innovative Idea

    Our application seeks to find the cheapest version of a given product. This can range from household objects like chairs to things like gas. The user will be asked to input a location from the US (e.g. Boston, MA), the item name, and a radius that the item should be found within. Once input, the application will send back information on the cheapest variation of that item within the radius centered around the location. It would send back things like address, price, whether it's in stock (if applicable), and potentially rating and item quality down the line. It's somewhat similar to Amazon, except you don't have to look for the shortest price yourself, the app will! Also, it's more geared towards in-person transactions in comparison to Amazon's online ones.


SECTION 3: 

    The main part of this app will sort things like distance, price, or popularity in increasing order. After which the app will return an item with the lowest price, lowest distance, and possibly highest popularity. Google maps will also be important for seeing how much is within our location radius. If quality and average rating is successfully implemented down the line, then our app would possibly accumulate common key words used to the descirbe the product in reviews and send it back to the user.
